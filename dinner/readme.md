# IKEA Swedish Meatballs Recipe

## Servings: 8

## Time to prepare: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Ingredients:

### Meatballs:
- 1½ pounds ground beef 85/15
- 3/4 pound finely ground pork
- 1 cup onion, finely diced
- 1 tablespoon fresh garlic, finely minced
- 1 cup plain bread crumbs
- 2 whole eggs
- 3/4 cup whole milk
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided

### Sauce:
- 1 1/4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 1/4 cups beef stock
- 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 2 teaspoon olive oil
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 2/3 cup all-purpose flour (10 tablespoons or 2.9 ounces as weighed on a kitchen scale)

### Others:
- Mashed potatoes: 1½ teaspoons kosher salt to salt water, 3 pounds potatoes, 1 cup whole milk or light cream, 1/2 pounds butter, ½ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon garlic powder. 
- Green beans
- Lingonberry Jam

## Equipment needed:
- Refrigerator
- Oven
- Pan and tools

## Steps for preparation:
1) In a large bowl, mix ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, bread crumbs, eggs, milk, salt, pepper and one tablespoon of oil. Mix just enough to combine and try not to overmix.
2) Use a one-once scoop and scoop out 55 one-ounce meatballs. Line them up on your cutting board and run a knife through each one which will yield 110 half-ounce pieces.
3) Roll each into a ball and line up on a sheet tray covered in parchment. Keep your hands wet while rolling.
4) Refrigerate on the sheet tray for one hour to set.
5) After one hour, preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
6) Line a second sheet tray with parchment paper.
7) Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat with one tablespoon of olive oil and once hot, gently place one third of the meatballs in the pan and cook on all sides for about 4-5 minutes. Use a small spatula or tongs to continually turn the meatballs to brown evenly. Remove these browned meatballs to the prepared sheet pan.
8) Repeat for the next two batches of oil and meatballs.
9) Once all the meatballs have browned and are now lined up on the sheet tray, place the sheet tray in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.
10) While the meatballs are cooking, heat the vegetable stock, beef stock, heavy cream, soy sauce and mustard in a small sauce pan. Mixture needs to be hot to prevent lumping in the sauce but does not need to boil. Set aside.
11) In a 4-5-quart pot, over medium heat melt butter in oil and add flour to make a roux. Cook and stir continually for 3-4 minutes until the raw flour smell is gone.
12) Gradually add the liquid to the roux while whisking. Heat this mixture to hot and bubbly. If the mixture gets too thick, thin down a little with milk or cream.
13) When the meatballs come out of the oven, add to the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes, green beans, and lingonberry jam.
